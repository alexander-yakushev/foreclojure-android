Because the children are ordered it's important that\r\nthe tree you return keeps the children of each node in order\r\nand that the old parent node, if any, is appended on the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nYour function will be given two args -- the name of the node\r\nthat should become the new root, and the tree to transform.\r\n","difficulty":"Hard","tags":["tree"],"tests":["(= '(n)\r\n   (__ 'n '(n)))","(= '(a (t (e)))\r\n   (__ 'a '(t (e) (a))))","(= '(e (t (a)))\r\n   (__ 'e '(a (t (e)))))","(= '(a (b (c)))\r\n   (__ 'a '(c (b (a)))))","(= '(d \r\n      (b\r\n        (c)\r\n        (e)\r\n        (a \r\n          (f \r\n            (g) \r\n            (h)))))\r\n  (__ 'd '(a\r\n            (b \r\n              (c) \r\n              (d) \r\n              (e))\r\n            (f \r\n              (g)\r\n              (h)))))","(= '(c \r\n      (d) \r\n      (e) \r\n      (b\r\n        (f \r\n          (g) \r\n          (h))\r\n        (a\r\n          (i\r\n          (j\r\n            (k)\r\n            (l))\r\n          (m\r\n            (n)\r\n            (o))))))\r\n   (__ 'c '(a\r\n             (b\r\n               (c\r\n                 (d)\r\n                 (e))\r\n               (f\r\n                 (g)\r\n                 (h)))\r\n             (i\r\n               (j\r\n                 (k)\r\n                 (l))\r\n               (m\r\n                 (n)\r\n                 (o))))))\r\n"],"title":"Tree reparenting","user":"chouser"},{"id":131,"description":"Given a variable number of sets of integers, create a function which returns true iff all of the sets have a non-empty subset with an equivalent summation.","difficulty":"Medium","tags":["math"],"tests":["(= true  (__ #{-1 1 99} \r\n             #{-2 2 888}\r\n             #{-3 3 7777})) ; ex. all sets have a subset which sums to zero","(= false (__ #{1}\r\n             #{2}\r\n             #{3}\r\n             #{4}))","(= true  (__ #{1}))","(= false (__ #{1 -3 51 9} \r\n             #{0} \r\n             #{9 2 81 33}))","(= true  (__ #{1 3 5}\r\n             #{9 11 4}\r\n             #{-3 12 3}\r\n             #{-3 4 -2 10}))","(= false (__ #{-1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6}\r\n             #{1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}))","(= true  (__ #{1 3 5 7}\r\n             #{2 4 6 8}))","(= true  (__ #{-1 3 -5 7 -9 11 -13 15}\r\n             #{1 -3 5 -7 9 -11 13 -15}\r\n             #{1 -1 2 -2 4 -4 8 -8}))","(= true  (__ #{-10 9 -8 7 -6 5 -4 3 -2 1}\r\n             #{10 -9 8 -7 6 -5 4 -3 2 -1}))"],"title":"Sum Some Set Subsets","user":"amcnamara"},{"id":132,"description":"Write a function that takes a two-argument predicate, a value, and a collection; and returns a new collection where the <code>value</code> is inserted between every two items that satisfy the predicate.","difficulty":"Medium","tags":["seqs","core-functions"],"tests":["(= '(1 :less 6 :less 7 4 3) (__ < :less [1 6 7 4 3]))","(= '(2) (__ > :more [2]))","(= [0 1 :x 2 :x 3 :x 4]  (__ #(and (pos? %) (< % %2)) :x (range 5)))","(empty?

<code>V</code>\r\nif the following conditions are satisfied:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>All vectors of <code>V</code> are used.</li>\r\n<li>Each row contains just one vector.</li>\r\n<li>The order of

Latin square of order 3 \r\nand one of order 2 which is included three times.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur aim is to implement a function which accepts a vector of vectors <code>V</code> as an argument, \r\nand returns a map which keys and values are integers. \r\nEach key should be the order of a Latin square included in <code>V</code>, \r\nand its value a count of <i>different</i> Latin squares of that order included in <code>V</code>. \r\nIf <code>V</code> does not include any Latin squares an empty map should be returned.\r\nIn the previous example the correct output of such a function is {3 1, 2 1} and <i>not</i> {3 1, 2 3}.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<sup>1</sup> Of course, we can consider sequences instead of vectors. \r\n<br />\r\n<sup>2</sup> Length of a vector is the number of elements in
