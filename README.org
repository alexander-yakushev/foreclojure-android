* 4Clojure for Android

  This is the source code for unofficial 4Clojure Android application. The app
  is a client for [[http://4clojure.com][4clojure.com]], which is a website for solving Clojure koans
  (short programming problems). 4Clojure for Android allows solving these koans
  on your mobile phone, without entering the browser, in both online and offline
  mode.

  Features so far:

  - Full synchronization with server (new problems and solutions are
    downloaded automatically)
  - Full offline support (network is not required to solve problems,
    solutions can be synchronized later)
  - In-client registration
  - Acceptable code editor (with highlighting and indentation)

  Plans for future:
  - Code golf
  - Integration with Clojail
